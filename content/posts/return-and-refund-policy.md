**Important Note:** Due to the nature of digital products, returns and refunds are generally not possible once a product has been downloaded or accessed. However, we understand that there may be certain situations where a refund might be warranted. This policy outlines the conditions under which we will consider a refund request for our digital products in India.

## Conditions for Refund:

**Non-functioning Product:** If the digital product you purchased is faulty or does not function as described, we will gladly offer you a full refund. Please contact us within 30 days of purchase with a detailed explanation of the issue you're facing.

**Accidental Purchase:** We understand that mistakes happen. If you accidentally purchased a digital product and haven't downloaded it yet, we may be able to offer a full refund. Please contact us immediately after your purchase to request a refund.

**Misrepresentation of Content:** If the product description significantly misrepresents the content of the digital product, we will offer a full refund.

## Products Not Eligible for Refunds:

**Downloaded Products:** Once a digital product has been downloaded, we cannot offer a refund due to the ease of replication.

**Partially Accessed Products:** If you have accessed a portion of the digital product (e.g., streamed a video lesson), we cannot offer a refund.

### How to Request a Refund:

To request a refund, please contact our customer support team within the specified timeframe mentioned above for each condition. You can [contact me here](/contact-me/).

In your request, please include your order number, the name of the digital product you wish to return, and a clear explanation of why you are requesting a refund.

**Processing Refunds:**

If your refund request is approved, we will process the refund within 6 business days using the original payment method you used for the purchase.

**Consumer Rights under Indian Law:**

We acknowledge the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (CPA) and the rights it grants to Indian consumers. This policy is designed to be compliant with the CPA, but if there is any discrepancy, the terms of the CPA will prevail.
